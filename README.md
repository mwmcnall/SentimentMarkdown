# The Adventure Zone Sentiment Analysis

The Adventure Zone is a DnD podcast. I created an R script to scrape the transcripts from online.

This project was designed to do a few things:

- Explain Sentiment Analysis and what it can be used for
- Show the code behind a few things
- Show some of the insights of the Sentiment Analysis process
